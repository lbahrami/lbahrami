# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leila Bahrami

Iâ€™m a **Geospatial Analyst** and **Urban Enthusiast** motivated by using data to promote social and ecological resilience. With a multidisciplinary background in **Landscape Architecture** and **Geospatial Analysis**, I lead projects that utilize spatial data and environmental policy to build communities and spaces that are sustainable and inclusive. I strive to provide accurate and actionable insights to solve complex problems and inform decision-making.

## ðŸ”§ Tech & Tools
- **Geospatial Analytics**: ESRI ArcGIS Software Suite (Raster, Vector, AGOL, ArcGIS Enterprise) , ArcPy, Google Earth Engine,
R Studio, Python
- **Remote Sensing**: ENVI, Python Image processing, UAV Mapping
- **Statistical Analysis**: Machine learning (supervised and unsupervised), Predictive Modeling in R, Spatial Statistics
- **Planning & Design**: Landscape Design, Urban Planning, Climate Resilience, Adobe Suite, Rhino, Grasshopper, Autocad, Google Sketchup

## ðŸ“š Current Focus
Iâ€™m currently involved in **research on assessing the effectiveness of blue-green infrastructure** for urban resilience and biodiversity enhancement. This involves using **machine learning models** to predict ecological outcomes and optimize design strategies. 


## ðŸ’¡ Let's Connect
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on projects related to urban resilience, climate adaptation, or advanced geospatial analysis.
